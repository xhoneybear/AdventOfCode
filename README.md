# Advent of Code
This is my collection of scripts (and generated inputs) written for Advent of Code. Currently 15 scripts for year 2022 written in Python, with 2023 in progress in both Python and Java! Scripts for days 1-14 should work well, script for day 15 part 2 is highly unoptimized and possibly incorrect.

The scripts were written with no intention to be optimized "by the book", I mostly tried to be creative and come up with my own solutions. That is why, for example, day 12 script *should* work, but it is unoptimized, might be buggy and is rather limited to fairly small board sizes. On the other hand coming up with my own solution derived from my filling algorithm I used in my [minesweeper](https://github.com/xhoneybear/minesweeper) instead of implementing a well-known pathfinding algorithm like A\* allowed me to improve the former as well. :slightly_smiling_face:

This repository was made as a showcase. You can use it to look it up for hints or for testing purposes, please **do not** use it to cheat your way through the calendar! Good luck to all participants :crossed_fingers:
