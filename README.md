# Advent of Code 2022
This is my collection of AoC 2022 scripts. 14 scripts are usable and should output a correct result, day 15 script only works for the first part of the exercise (second part is highly unoptimized and, unless you use a supercomputer, would take eternity to *MAYBE* display a result).

While making these I didn't try to optimize them in the most optimal way - I tried to be creative and come up with my own ideas. That's why on day 12 I didn't just implement a well-known pathfinding algorithm like A\*. While my algorithm *should* work, it might be very buggy, not production-ready and very limited to rather small areas, but it's of my own design which not only am I proud of, it also allowed me to improve the filling algorithm in my [minesweeper](https://github.com/xhoneybear/minesweeper) code :slightly_smiling_face:

Repository created as a showcase. Please use it only for hints and testing, it is not meant to be used to cheat!
